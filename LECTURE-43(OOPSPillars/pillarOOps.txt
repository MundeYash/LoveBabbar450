4 Pillar of obejct oriented Programming 

1. Encapsulation(data hiding / information hiding ) : wrapping of data member and member functions 
. fully encapsulated class : all the data members and  member functions are marked private 
        advantages : -> improves security by hiding the data 
         if we want we can make class read only 
         code reusability 


2.Inheritance   : ->(inherited some properties and member functions of one class to another )
example :-> human class (super class / parent class)-> male class (inherit class / derived class / sub-class )


// private member of the class is not accessible 

// Types of Inheritance :->
. single level inheritance 
. multi level inheritance 
. multiple inheritance : inheriting two or more class in the same class 
. Hybrid inheritance
. Heirarchical inheritance 

// Advantages of types of inheritance 



// Inheritance Abmiguity
Use scope resolution operation for class inherited from the two classes having the same function (::)



// POLYMORPHISM : many forms (means declaring the same function with same name and different parameter values )


1. Run time polymorphism (dynamic polymorphism)

2.Compile time polymorphism(static polymorphism)

// overloading : for overloading of function we have to change the input paramters 


// Run Time polymorphism:
