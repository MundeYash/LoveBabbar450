What is Object Oriented Programming ? 


OOps object and classes 
class - It is a user defined data type 
Object - object is instance/ format / example of class 
for accessing properties of data members of the class we need to use (dot.)operator 


Access Modifiers -> public , private and protected 


//Getter and setter :-> for accessing / changing data member of private members (indirect way of accessing the private data members)
// Dynamically creation of object of a class 

// constructor : default constructor is called whenever the object is created : 
. It does not have return type , have same name of class , does not have input parameter 


// concept of this Pointer 

//defautl constructor , parameter constructor , copy constructor 

// deep copy and shallow copy 
IN SHALLOW    copy we are accessing the same the values different names
the values of name pointer is also pointer to the same location (it is similiar like pass by reference )
. default  constructor does the deep coy 

// Copy Assignment Operator 

// Destructor : for the deleting the created constructor 
. memory deallocate 
. same name as name of class 
. no return type 
. created using the not (~)sign 
. for static allocation the destructor is called automatically 

// Static keyword : we do not need create object for  accessing the static data member of a class 
. It does not belong to the object , it only belongs to the created class 

// Static functions : 
. they do not have this pointer .
. Static function can only be able to access the static member of the class 




HOMEWORK : Padding , Greedy alignment , constant key word  -> object creation, data members  , function creation , Intialisation list
